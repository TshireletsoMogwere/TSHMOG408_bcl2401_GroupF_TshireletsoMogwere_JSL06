# [JSL06] Submission: CodeCuisine Menu Display System Challenge

## Objectives:

- Create and use functions to dynamically populate the menu items on the page.
- Implement a callback function to handle adding items to the order.
- Use closures to maintain the state of the order.
- Utilize function expressions and anonymous functions.
- Call built-in functions and create custom functions to manage the menu and order system.



    - `menu`: The `menu` object contains sample menu data, including categories and items. You can expand this menu with more items if needed.

    - `displayMenuItems(menu)`: This function should dynamically create and display menu items grouped by category. Iterate over the `menu` object and create HTML elements for each category and item. Attach event listeners to the menu items to handle adding items to the order.

    - `addToOrder(itemName)`: Implement this callback function to update the order summary when an item is added. You can use closures to maintain the state of the order. Calculate and update the total price accordingly.

    - `initMenuSystem(menu)`: Call the `displayMenuItems` function with the menu data and attach event listeners to menu items.

By following these steps and completing the challenge, you will demonstrate your ability to create interactive web applications using JavaScript. Good luck, and enjoy building the CodeCuisine Menu Display System!
