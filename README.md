# [JSL06] Submission: CodeCuisine Menu Display System Challenge

# Overview
This project involved creating a simple menu display and ordering system using JavaScript. The system displays menu items grouped by categories and allows users to add items to an order list, with the total price dynamically updating as items are added.

# Project Structure

**index.html**: HTML file containing the structure of the web page.
**styles.css**: CSS file containing styles for the menu display.
**script.js**: JavaScript file containing the logic for displaying menu items, adding items to the order, and initializing the menu system.

Object Manipulation: Learned how to work with JavaScript objects to organize menu items by category.
DOM Manipulation: Practiced creating and manipulating DOM elements dynamically to display menu items and handle user interactions.

2. Event Handling
Event Listeners: Gained experience attaching event listeners to DOM elements to respond to user actions, such as clicking on menu items to add them to the order list.
